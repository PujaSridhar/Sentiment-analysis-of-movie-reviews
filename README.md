In this project, we aim to use Sentiment Analysis on a set of movie reviews given	by reviewers and try to understand what their overall reaction to the movie was, i.e. if they liked the movie or they hated it. We aim to utilize the relationships of  the words in the review to predict the overall polarity of the review. 
We have successfully developed a more accurate Semantic Analysis For Movie Revives with neural networks in Python, with its accuracy being close to 87%. We have deployed the best running model using the Flask framework. The results of a query can be obtained without any real-time delay.
